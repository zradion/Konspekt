  <h1>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h1>
  <h3>characters and places:</h3>
  <p>
Arthur Dent<br>
Mr.L.Prosser was, as they say, only human.<br>
Ford Prefect was not from Guildford as he usually claimed,<br>
but from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.<br>
"Horse and Groom" - bar.<br>
Damogran - planet five hundred thousand light years from the Sol.<br>
Zaphod Beeblebrox - President of the Imperial Galactic Government.<br>
He is two hundred years old. Roughly humanoid in appearance<br>
except for the extra head and third arm.<br>
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for<br>
other Vogons.His highly domed nose rose high above a small<br>
piggy forehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick and<br>
waterproof. As a fairly typical Vogon - thoroughly vile.<br>
Dentrassis - are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but<br>
pleasant bunch.<br>

  </p>
  <h3>events:</h3>
  <p>
Arthur is trying to protect his house, then gets drunk with<br>
Ford Prefect and gets on a spaceship of the Vogon Constructor<br>
Fleet. The Earth was demolished.<br>
